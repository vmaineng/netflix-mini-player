# 📺 Netflix Mini Player – UX Engineer Case Study  

## 🔥 Overview  
This project explores the concept of a **Netflix Mini Player**, designed to allow users to continue watching their current show or movie while browsing for the next title.  

As a **UX Engineer**, I focused on bridging design and engineering:  
- **Design Thinking:** Understanding user pain points and opportunities.  
- **UX Engineering:** Prototyping the feature with real-world technologies to demonstrate feasibility.  

> ✨ A small feature can transform the user experience by giving viewers more control, flexibility, and seamless multitasking.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Currently, Netflix requires users to stop or pause playback when navigating away from the video detail page. This creates friction for binge-watchers who want to explore new content without interrupting their current stream.  

**Key Pain Points:**  
- Interrupted viewing when searching for new shows.  
- Lack of flexibility compared to competitors with mini players.  
- Missed opportunity for increased engagement.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
The **Netflix Mini Player** concept introduces:  
- 🎥 A floating video window that persists while browsing.  
- 🖱️ Lightweight and distraction-free controls (pause, close, resize).  
- 📱 Responsive design across devices.  
- ✅ Non-intrusive placement to balance browsing space with active viewing.  

This approach aligns with Netflix’s core mission: *“entertainment without limits.”*
